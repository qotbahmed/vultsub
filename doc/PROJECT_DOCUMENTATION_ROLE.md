### 2. Scope

* Define what's included and what's explicitly excluded.

---

### 3. Persona

---

### 5. User Story

Format each story as:

**As a [persona], I want [feature] so that [value].**

---

### 6. Acceptance Criteria

Write in **checklist** or **Given/When/Then** format:

* Functional success cases.
* Edge/failure cases.

---

### 7. Business Logic

* Define rules, workflows, restrictions, and dependencies.
* Include system validations, triggers, and automation rules.

---

### 8. Technical Architecture

### 9. Data Structure (Database Tables)

For every feature, specify database models using **table form**.

Template Example:

**Table: users**

| Field          | Type      | Constraints                 | Description            |
| -------------- | --------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| id             | INT (PK)  | Auto Increment              | Unique user ID         |
| name           | VARCHAR   | NOT NULL                    | Full name              |
| email          | VARCHAR   | UNIQUE, NOT NULL            | Login email            |
| password_hash  | VARCHAR   | NOT NULL                    | Encrypted password     |
| created_at     | TIMESTAMP | DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP   | Account creation date  |

**Table: subscriptions**

| Field       | Type     | Constraints                 | Description            |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| id          | INT (PK) | Auto Increment              | Subscription ID        |
| user_id     | INT (FK) | NOT NULL                    | Linked to users.id     |
| type        | ENUM     | ('trial','paid','expired')  | Subscription status    |
| start_date  | DATE     | NOT NULL                    | Subscription start     |
| end_date    | DATE     | NOT NULL                    | Subscription end       |
| status      | VARCHAR  | NOT NULL                    | active/expired/locked  |

---

### 10. Testing Scenarios

* **Functional Tests:** Happy path, standard flows.
* **Edge Cases:** Invalid input, expired trials, failed payments, unexpected conditions.
* **Performance Tests:** Load, stress, and concurrency.
* **Security Tests:** Auth, permissions, data integrity.
